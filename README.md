enketo-core Smap Fork
================

A fork of Enketo Core. Unless you are working with the Smap Server specifically you should probably be forking the original enketo-core repository.

Follow the [Smap blog](http://blog.smap.com.au) or go to the web site at [Smap](http://www.smap.com.au) to stay up to date.

The remaining text in this readme file is from the forked repository and hence acknowledgements are those made by the enketo-core developers so firstly I would like to acknowledge the work of Martin Van de Rijdt in creating this library.

For details on using this fork refer to [Web Forms](https://github.com/nap2000/webformsClient) - Implementation of enketo-core in Smap Server
